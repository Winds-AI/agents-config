# FastAPI-Style Explanation Pattern

## Default Order
1. Show minimal runnable snippet.
2. Explain parts with clear labels.
3. Include one practical scenario if useful.
4. Expand only when learner asks or needs it.

## Example Shape
- snippet first
- labeled lines next
- optional scenario last

This keeps explanations concrete and avoids long theory-first blocks.
