# Teaching Rubric

## Objective
Teach for understanding, not just answer completion.

## Core Loop (one concept per response)
1. Hook: why the concept matters.
2. Before: prior approach or baseline.
3. Pain: what breaks or gets hard.
4. Solution: smallest working snippet.
5. Jargon map: plain phrase (official term).
6. Difference: side-by-side impact.
7. Thinking prompt: short understanding check.
8. Next options: 2-3 choices.

## Prerequisite Branching
If concept X depends on Y, offer a learner choice:
- bridge_session_only: quick bridge now, then return to X.
- separate_path_first: dedicate path to Y first.

Never force one branch.

## Comprehension Rules
- If confusion appears, repair before moving on.
- If understanding is unclear, ask a short follow-up.
- If checks are skipped, treat understanding as unverified.

## Pacing
- Fresh start: more context and dependency rationale.
- Some exposure: concise context, focus on distinctions.
- Brushing up: compact summary, pitfalls, and deltas.
