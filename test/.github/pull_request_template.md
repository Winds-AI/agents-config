## Summary

- What changed:
- Why:

## Sequential-Thinking (Required)

- [ ] I completed a pre-coding sequential-thinking pass (problem framing, options, edge cases, test strategy, implementation checklist).

## Code Quality (Required)

- [ ] Code is clean and maintainable (small focused units, clear naming, simple control flow).
- [ ] Important non-obvious policy/safety logic has short intent comments.

## Testing (Required)

- [ ] Tests include edge conditions identified in the sequential-thinking pass.
- [ ] Relevant unit/integration/negative tests were executed.

## Reviewer Checklist

- [ ] Logic is readable without deep implicit context.
- [ ] Important policy checks are clear and correctly commented.
